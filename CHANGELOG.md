## [Unreleased]

## [4.1.0] - 2024-02-16

### Added
- Naming checks for the default ruff configuration.

### Fixed
- Missing shebang in python check tools. This caused errors depending
  on which exec function you used.

## [4.0.0] - 2024-02-14

### Added
- Support for overriding python linters config.

### Changed
- Ruff default configuration. Now picks upp issues similar to to the
  alternative (isort, black, flake etc).

## [3.1.0] - 2024-02-08

### Added
- Ruff support for python components. Currently have to opt in by
  setting `defaultCheckPhase = "ruffStandardTests";` on
  `base.languages.python`. This will change the global default for the
  python language. To set it for a single component set
  `installCheckPhase` to `standardTests` or `ruffStandardTests` or any
  combination of the two. To individually set the formatter set the
  `formatter` on the component to either "standard" (black + isort) or
  to "ruff" (ruff üêï). If formatter is not set it will be detected from the value of `installCheckPhase`.

## [3.0.0] - 2024-02-06

### Added
- `gen-default-crates` command to generate the list of default crates shipped with
  Nedryglot.
- Support for nixpkgs versions up to 23.11

### Changed
- Now uses Nedryland version 10.0.0

## [2.0.1] - 2023-12-05

### Fixed
- C does not expect `doc` and `man` output if doxygen is disabled.
- C platform override now lets the user override all attributes of the derivation, not
  just the attributes sent in. For example, `lintPhase` was hardcoded in `mkDerivation`
  for all C platforms.

## [2.0.0] - 2023-11-07

### Added
- `build` shell command for python.

### Fixed
- Terraform deploy will now exit with non-zero exit code if deploy failed.
- Give pylint a $HOME so it won't complain when writing cache and stats.

### Changed
- Nedryglot now requires version 9.0.0 of nedryland or higher.
- Python linting tools now combines their configs during runtime instead of build time.
- Rust components now only uses vendored dependencies. Dependencies
  can be vendored with the `fetchCrate` function. Refer to the docs
  for more information.

## [1.1.0] - 2023-04-21
